## install git 
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install git
  
## config git
1. generate ssh
  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "name@company.com"
  ```
2. add sshkey
  copy the rsa_pub to remote repository

3. config name and mail
  ```
  git config --global user.name "name"
  git config --global user.email "name@company.com"
  ```

## using git
1. get remote branch to local:

  ```
  git checkout --track origin/branch-name
  ```
 
  The command will create a local branch named branch-name ,tracking the remote branch origin/branch-name.

2. track is shortband for 

  ```
  git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]
  ```

If you are trying to "checkout" a new remote branch (that exists only on the remote, but not locally), here's what you'll need:

```
git fetch origin
git checkout --track origin/<remote_branch_name>
```
3. delete local branch and remote branch
```
# delete branch local
$ git branch -D feature/abc

# delete remote branch
$ git push origin --delete feature/abc
```
Note: local branch has nothing to do with remote branch, they are completely separate objects.
